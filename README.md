VERSION 1.0


DESCRIPTION:
	Boids will start flocking on their own. They will dynamically avoid the obstacles if they are too close to them, regardless of the obstacles' position(s).


INSTRUCTIONS:
	Press the Space Bar to spawn more boids. Click the Left Mouse Button to spawn an obstacle at the mouse location, press and hold to drag the obstacle to the mouse position. Click the Right Mouse Button to disable the obstacle. Press the 'W' key to switch between the circular obstacle and the squared one.


DISCLAIMER:
	This technique is not very efficient, and I will be iterating on it and updating this file and the blog post when I do so.
